In a party of N people, only one person is known to everyone. Such a person may be present in the party, if yes, (s)he doesn’t know anyone in the party. We can only ask questions like “does A know B? “. Find the stranger (celebrity) in minimum number of questions.

We can describe the problem input as an array of numbers/characters representing persons in the party. We also have a hypothetical function HaveAcquaintance(A, B) which returns true if A knows B, false otherwise. How can we solve the problem, try yourself first.

We measure the complexity in terms of calls made to HaveAcquaintance().

idea from: http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/the-celebrity-problem/
!!! use a stack:
 We have following observation based on elimination technique (Refer Polya’s How to Solve It book).

If A knows B, then A can’t be celebrity. Discard A, and B may be celebrity.
If A doesn’t know B, then B can’t be celebrity. Discard B, and A may be celebrity.
Repeat above two steps till we left with only one person.
Ensure the remained person is celebrity. (Why do we need this step?)
We can use stack to verify celebrity.

Push all the celebrities into a stack.
Pop off top two persons from the stack, discard one person based on return status of HaveAcquaintance(A, B).
Push the remained person onto stack.
Repeat step 2 and 3 until only one person remains in the stack.
Check the remained person in stack doesn’t have acquaintance with anyone else.
